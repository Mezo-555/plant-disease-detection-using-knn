# Plant Disease Classification using KNN

This project classifies plant diseases using **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** based on leaf images. The goal is to quickly diagnose plant health and prevent crop damage. It can be particularly useful in agricultural settings to detect diseases at an early stage and reduce crop losses.

## Key Features

* Efficient classification of plant diseases using image data.
* Uses KNN for multi-class classification.
* Easily extendable to include more disease types or environmental factors.
* Simple deployment and prediction process.

## Applications

* Early detection of plant diseases.
* Agricultural monitoring and field assessments.
* Integration with IoT devices for real-time analysis.
